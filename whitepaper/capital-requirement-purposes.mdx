title: Capital Requirement & Purposes
---

We are seeking up to &dollar;40 Million in funding to pilot our Virtual Card concept, Licensing, product development, intensive marketing, and MobiCash rollout in the under Banked and Unbanked regions. 

The required Capital will further assist in the improvements of our system and intensive marketing, for our diagnostic report suggested that our system is under marketed. 

A system of such a broad product should in all sense of fairness boast at least a million users and with a proper marketing which some of the funds will be used for, this target can be achieved with ease.

We are seeking to raise funds through a variety of options which include investment for a percentage stake in the company, a strategic private token sale for institutional investors which terms of investment will be discussed with the prospective investors.

Alternatively, you can become part of the family by simply buying a fraction of DBA on public platforms such as **DafriPremier**, **LBank**, **Probit Exchange**, and **Pancake Swap**.
