title: "FinTech Making Waves In Africa"
---

With an ever-changing and constantly developing economic climate, financial technology platforms are racing to keep in tune with an increasingly digital financial world.

Roughly 1.4 billion people call Africa home, and more than half of these citizens do not have a bank account. This is why the African fintech sector is one of the fastest growing in the world, attracting the likes of telcos and multinational corporations. Most citizens have access to a cellphone and SIM card, meaning that the opportunity to provide digital wallets for mobile money is massive.

The rise of fintech and mobile money in Africa is spurred on by providing financial freedom to the unbanked. Telcos and fintech providers can reach citizens where banks cannot. Currently, the top five African countries with fintech investment potentials are South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, and Ghana. These are multi-billion dollar industries that are still growing at a rapid pace.
