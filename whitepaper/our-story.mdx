title: 'Our Story In Years'

DafriPremier™ was founded on a notion that Africa should have its own payment company built by those who understand its culture and market dynamism.

In 2020, a group of aggrieved digital entrepreneurs who were left stranded following an arbitrary decision taken by one of the payment giants to disable and dislodge cashout mechanisms available to Africans on their platform—leaving a multitude of Africans with funds in their wallet without an alternative to get their funds out—set the idea that today is DafriPremier™ in motion.

In 2021, we raised &dollar;1.5 million in a pre-seed round through strategic ICO and launchpad events. In the same year, we acquired the banking status of First Standard LTD, and our native token DBA Currency reached an all-time high of &dollar;39 per token with a staggering &dollar;2.8 billion in market capitalization.

In 2022, our confidence was buoyed when we received interest from SoftBank, one of the largest investment banks in the world. In the same year, we joined the likes of Absa Bank and Standard Bank at the main sponsor lounge at the Blockchain Africa conference, where we delivered a keynote address.

In 2023, subsequent interest came in light of a R602 million (&dollar;30 million) offer made by a South African holding company for a majority stake in the startup. In the same year, a decision was taken for an overhaul of the system and rebranding that would adopt a less restrictive trading name, a decision taken in the best interest of the brand.

In 2024/2025, we rebranded to DafriPremier™ and released our elegantly designed, super-intuitive new system with increased features and an ecosystem that is interconnected to global financial institutions with a combined user base that exceeds 900 million—each of them a potential or already a DAFRI client.
