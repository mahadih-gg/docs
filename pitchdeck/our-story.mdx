## Our Story In Years

### 2020: The Inception
In 2020, a group of aggrieved digital entrepreneurs who were left stranded following an arbitrary decision taken by one of the payment giants to disable and dislodge cashout mechanism available to Africans on their platform set the idea that today is DafriPremier™ in motion. This left multitude of Africans with funds in their wallet without alternative to get their funds out.

### 2021: Initial Growth
In 2021, we raised &dollar;1.5 million in a pre-seed round through strategic Ico and launchpad events. In the same year we acquired the banking status of First Standard LTD, and our native token DBA Currency reached an all time high of &dollar;39 per a token with a staggering &dollar;2.8 billion in market capitalization. 


### 2022: Gaining Recognition
In 2022, our confidence was buoyed when we received an interest from SoftBank, one of the largest investment banks in the world. In the same year we joined the likes of Absa Bank and Standard Bank at the main sponsor lounge at the Blockchain Africa conference where we delivered a keynote address.

### 2023: Strategic Restructuring
In 2023, a subsequent interest came in light of a R602 million (&dollar;30 million) offer made by a South African holding company for a majority stake in the startup. In the same year, a decision was taken for overhaul of the system and rebranding that will adopt a less restrictive trading name, a decision taken in the best interest of the brand.

### 2024/2025: Rebranding & Expansion
In 2024/2025, we rebranded to DafriPremier™ and released our elegantly designed super intuitive new system with increased features and ecosystem that is interconnected to global financial institutions with a combined user base that exceeds 900 million, each of them a potential or already a DAFRI client.
