### In Conclusion

Some of our products boast the capability to operate as an independent system and are able to raise independent capital. DafriCheck Out, Mobi Cash, Crypto Ecommerce, Fiat Bridge, P2P Marketplace, and DafriFX possess the ability to operate as independent systems and could successfully raise funds independently given the number of one product FinTech raises in recent years in Africa. Whilst these highly useful products are packed under **DafriPremier™**, it is a testament to the underlying potential that makes **DafriPremier™** an investable project.
