## The Rise of Fintech

Over the past decade, technological progress and innovation have catapulted the fintech sector from the fringes to the forefront of financial services. And the growth has been fast and furious, buoyed by the robust growth of the banking sector, rapid digitization, changing customer preferences, and increasing support of investors and regulators. During this decade, fintechs have profoundly reshaped certain areas of financial services with their innovative, differentiated, and customer-centric value propositions, collaborative business models, and cross-skilled and agile teams.

## The Future of Banking

Banking is facing a future marked by fundamental restructuring. As researchers recently noted, banks and nonbanks are competing to fulfill distinct customer needs in five cross-industry arenas in this new era:
- Everyday banking
- Investment advisory
- Complex financing
- Mass wholesale intermediation
- Banking as a service (BaaS)

## Digital Transformation

At the same time, macro tailwinds are powering the growth of fintechs and the broader financial-services ecosystem. Digital adoption is no longer a question but a reality: **around 73 percent of the world's interactions with banks now take place through digital channels**.

Moreover, retail consumers globally now have the same level of satisfaction and trust in fintechs as they have with incumbent banks. In fact, 41 percent of retail consumers surveyed by McKinsey in 2021 said they planned to increase their fintech product exposure.

## Global Impact

The demand—and need—for fintech products is higher across developing economies. In 2022, for example, Africa had almost 800 million mobile accounts, almost half of the whole world's total.

B2B firms' demand for fintech solutions also is growing. In 2022, 35 percent of the small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in the United States considered using fintechs for lending, better pricing, and integration with their existing platforms. And in Asia, 20 percent of SMEs leveraged fintechs for payments and lending.

## Investment and Growth Potential

Investors are adapting to a new financial paradigm with higher interest rates and inflation, which has altered their assessment of risk and reward. McKinsey's research shows that revenues in the fintech industry are expected to grow almost three times faster than those in the traditional banking sector between 2023 and 2028.

  Compared with the 6 percent annual revenue growth for traditional banking, fintechs could post annual revenue growth of 15 percent over the next five years.

These trends are also coinciding with—and in many ways catalyzing—the maturation of the fintech industry.
